Let's approach Service A design step by step following industry standards. Here's a comprehensive list of files and dependencies you would need to implement Service A effectively:

## Required Files for Service A

### Configuration Files
1. `application.properties` or `application.yml` - Core application configuration
2. `logback-spring.xml` - Logging configuration

### Java Source Files

#### Main Application
1. `ServiceAApplication.java` - Main Spring Boot application class

#### API Layer
1. `UserRequestController.java` - REST controller handling user requests
2. `RequestDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for incoming requests
3. `ResponseDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for outgoing responses

#### Service Layer
1. `UserRequestService.java` - Interface for business logic
2. `UserRequestServiceImpl.java` - Implementation of business logic
3. `ServiceBClient.java` - Client for communicating with Service B

#### Transaction Management
1. `TransactionManager.java` - Custom transaction management
2. `TransactionLogRepository.java` - Repository for transaction logging
3. `TransactionLog.java` - Entity for storing transaction information

#### Resilience Layer
1. `CircuitBreakerConfig.java` - Circuit breaker configuration
2. `RetryConfig.java` - Retry mechanism configuration

#### Recovery Mechanism
1. `ReconciliationService.java` - Service for handling recovery after crashes
2. `RecoveryController.java` - Admin endpoint for manual recovery actions

#### Exception Handling
1. `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` - Centralized exception handling
2. `ServiceAExceptions.java` - Custom exceptions for Service A
3. `ErrorResponse.java` - Standardized error response structure

## Dependencies (for pom.xml or build.gradle)

### Core Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Web - For RESTful services
2. Spring Boot Starter Data JPA - For database operations
3. Spring Boot Starter Actuator - For health checks and monitoring

### Resilience Dependencies
1. Resilience4j or Netflix Hystrix - For circuit breaker pattern
2. Spring Retry - For retry mechanism

### Database Dependencies
1. Database driver (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) - For persistent storage
2. Spring Boot Starter JPA - For ORM functionality
3. Liquibase or Flyway - For database migration management

### Monitoring and Observability
1. Micrometer - For metrics collection
2. Prometheus client - For metrics exposure
3. Spring Cloud Sleuth - For distributed tracing

### Testing Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Test - For unit and integration testing
2. Mockito - For mocking external services
3. Testcontainers - For integration testing with real databases
4. WireMock - For mocking Service B responses

### Utility Dependencies
1. Lombok - For reducing boilerplate code
2. Jackson - For JSON processing
3. Apache Commons - For utility functions
4. SLF4J and Logback - For logging

This list provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing Service A with appropriate transaction boundaries, threading models, and mechanisms to handle the failure scenarios described in the assignment.

-----------------------

I'll provide a list of the required files for Service B, mirroring the approach we took for Service A. Since Service B is the counterpart in this distributed system, it will have similar components but potentially different responsibilities.

## Required Files for Service B

### Configuration Files
1. `application.properties` or `application.yml` - Core application configuration
2. `logback-spring.xml` - Logging configuration

### Java Source Files

#### Main Application
1. `ServiceBApplication.java` - Main Spring Boot application class

#### API Layer
1. `ServiceBController.java` - REST controller handling requests from Service A
2. `RequestDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for incoming requests
3. `ResponseDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for outgoing responses

#### Service Layer
1. `ProcessingService.java` - Interface for business logic
2. `ProcessingServiceImpl.java` - Implementation of business logic

#### Transaction Management
1. `LocalTransactionManager.java` - Manages local transactions
2. `TransactionLogRepository.java` - Repository for transaction logging
3. `TransactionLog.java` - Entity for storing transaction information

#### Saga Participant Components
1. `CompensationController.java` - Endpoints for compensation actions
2. `SagaParticipantService.java` - Service implementing Saga participant logic

#### Exception Handling
1. `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` - Centralized exception handling
2. `ServiceBExceptions.java` - Custom exceptions for Service B
3. `ErrorResponse.java` - Standardized error response structure

#### Health and Monitoring
1. `HealthCheckController.java` - Endpoints for health status
2. `MetricsCollector.java` - Component for collecting operational metrics

## Dependencies (for pom.xml or build.gradle)

### Core Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Web - For RESTful services
2. Spring Boot Starter Data JPA - For database operations
3. Spring Boot Starter Actuator - For health checks and monitoring

### Database Dependencies
1. Database driver (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) - For persistent storage
2. Spring Boot Starter JPA - For ORM functionality
3. Liquibase or Flyway - For database migration management

### Monitoring and Observability
1. Micrometer - For metrics collection
2. Prometheus client - For metrics exposure
3. Spring Cloud Sleuth - For distributed tracing

### Testing Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Test - For unit and integration testing
2. Mockito - For mocking external services
3. Testcontainers - For integration testing with real databases

### Utility Dependencies
1. Lombok - For reducing boilerplate code
2. Jackson - For JSON processing
3. Apache Commons - For utility functions
4. SLF4J and Logback - For logging

Service B's implementation would focus on:
1. Reliably processing requests from Service A
2. Supporting the Saga pattern as a participant
3. Providing compensation endpoints for rollback scenarios
4. Maintaining its own transaction log for recovery
5. Implementing appropriate health checks and monitoring

The key difference from Service A is that Service B doesn't need to orchestrate the Saga (assuming an orchestration-based approach) but needs to participate properly by supporting compensation actions and maintaining its own local transaction integrity.
