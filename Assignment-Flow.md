Below is a comprehensive list of files required to complete **Service A** based on the assignment requirements, adhering to industry standards for a structured, maintainable, and robust Spring Boot application. Each file is accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose.

---

### Configuration Files
- **`application.properties` or `application.yml`**  
  - **Purpose**: Central configuration file for Spring Boot, defining properties such as database settings (e.g., H2 in-memory), server port, thread pool settings, and Resilience4j configurations for fault tolerance.

- **`logback-spring.xml`**  
  - **Purpose**: Configures logging to track transaction states, debug failures, and monitor application behavior. Includes logger levels, appenders, and patterns for console/file output.

---

### Java Source Files

#### Main Application
- **`ServiceAApplication.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: The entry point of the Spring Boot application, containing the `main` method and the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation to bootstrap the service.

#### API Layer
- **`UserRequestController.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: REST controller to handle incoming HTTP requests from users, mapping endpoints to service-layer methods.

- **`RequestDTO.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Data Transfer Object (DTO) for incoming request payloads, with fields matching the expected structure and optional validation annotations.

- **`ResponseDTO.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: DTO for outgoing response payloads, containing fields like status, request ID, or other relevant data.

#### Service Layer
- **`UserRequestService.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Interface defining the business logic methods for processing user requests.

- **`UserRequestServiceImpl.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Implementation of the service interface, containing core logic such as local transaction handling, Saga coordination, and interactions with Service B.

- **`ServiceBClient.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: REST client for making calls to Service B, including resilience annotations (e.g., circuit breaker, retry) for fault tolerance.

#### Transaction Management
- **`TransactionLog.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: JPA entity class representing the transaction log to track Saga states, with fields like `requestId`, `status`, and `timestamp`.

- **`TransactionLogRepository.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Spring Data JPA repository interface for performing CRUD operations on the `TransactionLog` entity, with optional custom query methods.

#### Resilience Layer
- **`CircuitBreakerConfig.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Configuration class for Resilience4j circuit breaker, defining beans and properties to handle failures in Service B calls.

- **`RetryConfig.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Configuration class for retry mechanisms, specifying retry policies for external service interactions.

#### Recovery Mechanism
- **`ReconciliationService.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Service to handle recovery and reconciliation after crashes or failures, resolving incomplete Sagas during startup or on demand.

- **`RecoveryController.java`** (Optional)  
  - **Purpose**: REST controller providing admin endpoints for manual recovery actions or status checks.

#### Exception Handling
- **`GlobalExceptionHandler.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Centralized exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice` to catch and process exceptions, returning standardized error responses.

- **`ServiceAExceptions.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Custom exception classes specific to Service A, such as `ServiceBUnavailableException` or `ReconciliationFailedException`.

- **`ErrorResponse.java`**  
  - **Purpose**: Standardized structure for error responses, including fields like `errorCode`, `message`, and `timestamp`.

---

### Additional Files
- **`pom.xml`**  
  - **Purpose**: Maven build configuration file specifying project dependencies (e.g., Spring Boot, Resilience4j, JPA), plugins, and build settings.

- **`README.md`**  
  - **Purpose**: Project documentation providing an overview, setup instructions, and API details for developers and users.

- **`docker-compose.yml`** (Optional)  
  - **Purpose**: Defines services for containerizing Service A, the H2 database, and potentially Service B for deployment.

---

### Summary
This file structure ensures **Service A** is modular, maintainable, and resilient, following industry best practices such as:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct layers for API, business logic, and data access.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilience4j configurations for circuit breaking and retries.
- **Consistency**: Transaction logging and recovery mechanisms for Saga orchestration.
- **Error Management**: Centralized exception handling with custom exceptions.
- **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions.

These files collectively provide a robust foundation for Service A, enabling it to process user requests, coordinate with Service B, and handle failures effectively. Let me know if you need further details on any specific file!
-----------------------

I'll provide a list of the required files for Service B, mirroring the approach we took for Service A. Since Service B is the counterpart in this distributed system, it will have similar components but potentially different responsibilities.

## Required Files for Service B

### Configuration Files
1. `application.properties` or `application.yml` - Core application configuration
2. `logback-spring.xml` - Logging configuration

### Java Source Files

#### Main Application
1. `ServiceBApplication.java` - Main Spring Boot application class

#### API Layer
1. `ServiceBController.java` - REST controller handling requests from Service A
2. `RequestDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for incoming requests
3. `ResponseDTO.java` - Data Transfer Object for outgoing responses

#### Service Layer
1. `ProcessingService.java` - Interface for business logic
2. `ProcessingServiceImpl.java` - Implementation of business logic

#### Transaction Management
1. `LocalTransactionManager.java` - Manages local transactions
2. `TransactionLogRepository.java` - Repository for transaction logging
3. `TransactionLog.java` - Entity for storing transaction information

#### Saga Participant Components
1. `CompensationController.java` - Endpoints for compensation actions
2. `SagaParticipantService.java` - Service implementing Saga participant logic

#### Exception Handling
1. `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` - Centralized exception handling
2. `ServiceBExceptions.java` - Custom exceptions for Service B
3. `ErrorResponse.java` - Standardized error response structure

#### Health and Monitoring
1. `HealthCheckController.java` - Endpoints for health status
2. `MetricsCollector.java` - Component for collecting operational metrics

## Dependencies (for pom.xml or build.gradle)

### Core Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Web - For RESTful services
2. Spring Boot Starter Data JPA - For database operations
3. Spring Boot Starter Actuator - For health checks and monitoring

### Database Dependencies
1. Database driver (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) - For persistent storage
2. Spring Boot Starter JPA - For ORM functionality
3. Liquibase or Flyway - For database migration management

### Monitoring and Observability
1. Micrometer - For metrics collection
2. Prometheus client - For metrics exposure
3. Spring Cloud Sleuth - For distributed tracing

### Testing Dependencies
1. Spring Boot Starter Test - For unit and integration testing
2. Mockito - For mocking external services
3. Testcontainers - For integration testing with real databases

### Utility Dependencies
1. Lombok - For reducing boilerplate code
2. Jackson - For JSON processing
3. Apache Commons - For utility functions
4. SLF4J and Logback - For logging

Service B's implementation would focus on:
1. Reliably processing requests from Service A
2. Supporting the Saga pattern as a participant
3. Providing compensation endpoints for rollback scenarios
4. Maintaining its own transaction log for recovery
5. Implementing appropriate health checks and monitoring

The key difference from Service A is that Service B doesn't need to orchestrate the Saga (assuming an orchestration-based approach) but needs to participate properly by supporting compensation actions and maintaining its own local transaction integrity.
