## Encapsulation

### **Encapsulation: Definition and Importance in OOP**

#### **Definition of Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the practice of bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a **class**. This means that all the details about how the data is stored and manipulated are contained within the class, and access to this data is controlled through specific methods.

To put it simply, encapsulation is like putting your valuables in a secure box (class) and controlling access to it with a key (methods). Only the person with the key can open the box and interact with the valuables inside.

#### **Importance of Encapsulation in OOP**

**1. **Data Protection**:**
- **Encapsulation helps protect the internal state of an object** from unintended or harmful changes. By controlling how data is accessed or modified, you can ensure that the object remains in a valid state throughout its lifetime.
- Imagine a car’s engine (the data) being accessible to everyone. If people could tweak the engine without proper knowledge, it could lead to malfunctions. Encapsulation is like keeping the car’s engine under the hood, with only authorized mechanics (methods) allowed to make changes.

**2. **Modularity**:**
- Encapsulation allows you to **break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable pieces**. Each piece (or class) is responsible for a specific part of the system, and the details of how it works are hidden from the rest of the system.
- This modularity makes it easier to **understand, maintain, and update** your code. If you need to make a change, you can do so within one class without worrying about how it will affect other parts of the program.

**3. **Control Access**:**
- Encapsulation gives you **control over how the data in a class is accessed or modified**. By defining specific methods to interact with the data, you can enforce rules and validation, ensuring that only appropriate values are set or retrieved.
- For example, you might allow people to check the balance of their bank account (accessing data) but require a secure process to withdraw money (modifying data). This control prevents unauthorized or improper access.

**4. **Improved Code Maintenance**:**
- Encapsulation makes your code more maintainable. Since the internal details are hidden, you can change the implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the program that rely on it. This is crucial when your project grows and evolves over time.
- For example, if you decide to change how the engine in a car works, you don’t need to inform everyone who drives the car. They just need to know how to use the car’s interface (start, stop, accelerate), not the details of the engine.

**5. **Enhanced Security**:**
- By hiding the internal implementation and exposing only what is necessary, encapsulation helps to **protect sensitive data** and ensures that it is used correctly.
- Just like a bank vault protects money, encapsulation protects the critical parts of your code from being misused or altered in unintended ways.

Sure! Let's explore encapsulation using a real-life industry example, particularly within the context of a **banking system**. I’ll walk you through the concept of encapsulation with an example, including code snippets to illustrate how it’s implemented.

### **Encapsulation: Industry-Oriented Example with Code**

#### **Scenario: Managing a Bank Account**

In a banking system, a `BankAccount` class is used to manage customer accounts. Each account has a balance, and you want to control how the balance is accessed and modified to ensure the system's integrity and security.

#### **Step 1: Encapsulating Data**

First, we encapsulate the sensitive data by making the fields `private`. This means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, we provide public methods (getters and setters) to allow controlled access.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private fields - Encapsulated data
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the account
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to get the account balance (Getter)
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money into the account
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money from the account
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid or insufficient funds for withdrawal.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Using Encapsulation**

The encapsulation ensures that the `balance` field is not directly modified by any code outside the `BankAccount` class. Instead, the balance can only be changed through the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods, which include validation logic.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a bank account with an initial balance
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000.0);

        // Accessing the balance using the getter method
        System.out.println("Initial Balance: $" + account.getBalance());

        // Depositing money into the account
        account.deposit(500.0);
        System.out.println("Balance after deposit: $" + account.getBalance());

        // Trying to withdraw more money than available
        account.withdraw(2000.0);
        System.out.println("Balance after attempted withdrawal: $" + account.getBalance());

        // Withdrawing a valid amount
        account.withdraw(300.0);
        System.out.println("Balance after withdrawal: $" + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Encapsulation in Practice:**
    - The `BankAccount` class has private fields `accountNumber` and `balance`. These fields are hidden from outside the class, preventing direct access and modification.
    - The class provides public methods (`getBalance()`, `deposit()`, and `withdraw()`) to interact with these fields. These methods ensure that only valid operations are performed on the data.

2. **Why is this Important?**
    - **Data Integrity**: By controlling access to the balance through methods, you ensure that the balance is never set to an invalid value. For example, a negative deposit is not allowed, and withdrawals are only allowed if there are sufficient funds.
    - **Security**: The encapsulation hides the internal details of how the balance is managed. Users of the `BankAccount` class don’t need to know how the balance is stored or validated; they just use the public methods to interact with it.
    - **Maintainability**: If you need to change how the balance is calculated or stored in the future, you can do so without affecting the rest of your application. The public interface remains the same, ensuring that other parts of the codebase don’t break when you make changes.

#### **Real-World Scenario:**

In a real banking system, encapsulation would be critical for protecting sensitive financial data. For instance, an account's balance might also involve additional checks, such as verifying the user's identity or logging transactions for auditing purposes. Encapsulation ensures that these checks are consistently applied, no matter where the balance is accessed or modified within the system.

In summary, encapsulation is crucial for creating secure, maintainable, and reliable software, especially in sensitive domains like banking. By keeping data private and exposing only the necessary methods, you can protect the integrity of your system while maintaining flexibility and control.

### **Access Modifiers and Their Role in Encapsulation**

Access modifiers in Java are keywords that set the accessibility level of classes, methods, and variables. They are crucial in implementing encapsulation, as they define how the components of a class can be accessed or modified from other parts of the code. Understanding the role of access modifiers helps you control the visibility of your data and methods, thereby protecting the integrity of your objects.

#### **1. Private Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `private` access modifier restricts access to a class’s members (variables or methods) so that they can only be accessed or modified within the same class. No other class, not even a subclass, can directly interact with private members.

**Role in Encapsulation**:
- **Data Hiding**: `Private` access is the most restrictive form, which is ideal for protecting sensitive data. By marking a variable as private, you ensure that it cannot be changed from outside the class. This is a key aspect of encapsulation, as it prevents unintended or harmful modifications.
- **Controlled Access**: You can provide controlled access to these private members by using public methods (getters and setters). This way, you can enforce rules or validations before allowing any changes to the data.

**Example in Real Life**:
Think of your phone’s operating system. The internal files and processes are private, meaning they can't be accessed directly by users or apps. However, the OS provides specific interfaces (like app permissions) to interact with the system safely.

#### **2. Protected Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `protected` access modifier allows members to be accessed within their own class, by subclasses (even if they are in different packages), and by other classes in the same package. However, they are not accessible from unrelated classes outside the package.

**Role in Encapsulation**:
- **Inheritance and Encapsulation**: `Protected` is less restrictive than `private` and is often used to allow subclasses to inherit and modify behavior from the parent class. This is useful when you want to extend functionality in a controlled manner.
- **Partial Data Hiding**: While protected members are accessible in derived classes, they are still hidden from the rest of the application, ensuring that the encapsulation is maintained to some degree.

**Example in Real Life**:
Imagine a car manufacturer that provides basic engine designs to its subsidiaries. The core engine design is protected—subsidiaries can modify it for their specific models (like sports cars or trucks), but the design is not available to the general public or competing companies.

#### **3. Public Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `public` access modifier allows members to be accessed from any other class. There are no restrictions on visibility, meaning public members can be used by any class in any package.

**Role in Encapsulation**:
- **Interface to the Outside World**: Public members are typically used to define the interface of a class—how other classes can interact with it. For instance, methods that are meant to be used by other parts of the program are usually declared as public.
- **Minimal Encapsulation**: While public members are accessible everywhere, careful design is required to avoid exposing too much of the internal workings of a class. Overuse of public access can break encapsulation by making internal data and operations vulnerable to misuse.

**Example in Real Life**:
Consider a public library. The catalog of books (the public methods) is available to everyone, allowing them to search and borrow books. However, the internal processes of maintaining the books, like cataloging or procurement (the private methods), are not exposed to the public.

### **Summary of Access Modifiers in Encapsulation**

- **Private**: Maximizes encapsulation by hiding data from outside access, protecting the integrity of the object.
- **Protected**: Balances encapsulation with inheritance, allowing controlled extension of class functionality while still restricting access.
- **Public**: Exposes the necessary interface for interacting with a class, allowing external classes to use its functionality.

By using these access modifiers effectively, you can create well-encapsulated classes that maintain data integrity, support controlled extension through inheritance, and expose only the necessary functionality to the outside world. This makes your code more robust, maintainable, and secure.

Certainly! Let's explore the concept of access modifiers using a real-life industry-oriented example with code. We’ll use a **banking system** scenario to illustrate how `private`, `protected`, and `public` access modifiers play a role in encapsulation.

### **Industry-Oriented Example: Banking System**

**Scenario**:
We’re developing a banking system that includes a `BankAccount` class. This class will manage account details such as balance and account number. We’ll use access modifiers to encapsulate data and control access to it, ensuring the integrity and security of the account information.

#### **1. Private Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `private` access modifier restricts access to members of the class to within the class itself. No other class can access or modify these members directly.

**Use Case**:
We want to keep the account balance and account number hidden from other classes to prevent unauthorized access and modifications. Only methods within the `BankAccount` class should be able to interact with these sensitive details.

**Code Example**:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private fields - encapsulating data
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the account
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid or insufficient funds for withdrawal.");
        }
    }

    // Public method to get the balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `accountNumber` and `balance` fields are `private`. They are not accessible from outside the `BankAccount` class.
- The methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` are `public`. They provide controlled access to the `balance` field, ensuring that only valid operations are performed.

#### **2. Protected Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `protected` access modifier allows access to members within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.

**Use Case**:
Suppose we have a specialized type of account called `SavingsAccount` that extends `BankAccount`. We might want to allow `SavingsAccount` to access certain members of `BankAccount` directly.

**Code Example**:

```java
public class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {
    // Protected field
    protected double interestRate;

    // Constructor
    public SavingsAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance, double interestRate) {
        super(accountNumber, initialBalance);
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    // Public method to apply interest
    public void applyInterest() {
        double interest = getBalance() * interestRate;
        deposit(interest); // Using public deposit method from the superclass
        System.out.println("Applied interest: $" + interest);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `interestRate` field is `protected`, allowing it to be accessed directly by `SavingsAccount`.
- The `SavingsAccount` class uses the `deposit()` method from `BankAccount` to add interest to the balance.

#### **3. Public Access Modifier**

**Definition**:
The `public` access modifier allows members to be accessed from any other class. There are no restrictions on visibility.

**Use Case**:
We want to provide an interface for interacting with `BankAccount` that allows external classes to perform operations such as deposits and withdrawals.

**Code Example**:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a bank account
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000.0);

        // Accessing public methods
        account.deposit(500.0);
        System.out.println("Balance after deposit: $" + account.getBalance());

        account.withdraw(200.0);
        System.out.println("Balance after withdrawal: $" + account.getBalance());

        // Trying to access private fields directly (not allowed)
        // System.out.println(account.balance); // This would cause a compile-time error
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `BankAccount` class’s public methods (`deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`) are accessible from the `Main` class, allowing external code to interact with the account.
- Direct access to private fields like `balance` from outside the class is not allowed, which protects the internal state of the `BankAccount`.

### **Getters and Setters: Best Practices and Pitfalls**

#### **What Are Getters and Setters?**

Getters and setters are special methods used in object-oriented programming to access and update the values of private fields within a class. They are part of the encapsulation principle, which helps in controlling access to the data within an object.

- **Getters**: Methods that retrieve or "get" the value of a private field.
- **Setters**: Methods that set or update the value of a private field.

#### **Best Practices for Getters and Setters**

1. **Maintain Consistency**:
    - **Naming Conventions**: Follow standard naming conventions for getters and setters. For a field named `age`, the getter should be `getAge()` and the setter should be `setAge()`. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.

2. **Keep Methods Simple**:
    - **Minimal Logic**: Getters and setters should ideally contain minimal logic. They should just retrieve or update values. Complex logic or validation should be handled elsewhere.

3. **Validate Input in Setters**:
    - **Input Validation**: When setting a value, validate it to ensure it meets the required criteria. For example, if you have a `setAge(int age)` method, ensure the age is within a realistic range (e.g., 0-120).

4. **Use Immutable Objects Where Possible**:
    - **Immutability**: For classes where data should not change after creation, consider making the class immutable. This means removing setters and only providing getters.

5. **Document Your Methods**:
    - **Documentation**: Provide clear comments or documentation for your getters and setters, especially if they include validation logic or other significant operations.

6. **Be Mindful of Performance**:
    - **Efficiency**: If your getters and setters are accessing or modifying data in a way that impacts performance, be aware of potential bottlenecks.

#### **Pitfalls to Avoid with Getters and Setters**

1. **Overexposing Internal State**:
    - **Avoid Direct Exposure**: Be cautious about exposing internal data through getters. If a getter method provides direct access to a mutable collection or object, external code might alter it unexpectedly.

2. **Too Much Logic in Getters and Setters**:
    - **Complexity**: Avoid placing complex logic in getters and setters. They should be simple accessors. Complex business logic or calculations should be handled in separate methods.

3. **Allowing Unrestricted Changes**:
    - **Uncontrolled Changes**: If setters do not validate the input properly, they can allow invalid data to be set, leading to inconsistent or erroneous states in your object.

4. **Redundant Getters and Setters**:
    - **Avoid Redundancy**: Only provide getters and setters for fields that need to be accessed or modified from outside the class. Overuse of getters and setters can clutter your class and expose unnecessary details.

5. **Breaking Encapsulation**:
    - **Encapsulation Violation**: If you provide too many setters or overly expose internal fields, you might break the encapsulation principle. This makes your class less flexible and more difficult to maintain.

#### **Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine a bank account as a class:

- **Getters**: Just like a bank employee gives you a statement when you ask about your balance, a getter method retrieves the value of a field.
- **Setters**: When you deposit money, you inform the bank employee to update your balance. A setter method updates the value of a field based on the input provided.

**Best Practices**:
- Ensure that the bank employee (setter) checks if the deposit amount is valid before updating your balance.
- The employee should only provide the balance (getter) without modifying it.

**Pitfalls**:
- Avoid letting anyone change your balance without checks (unrestricted setters).
- Don’t let the employee (getter) expose sensitive details or internal processes that are not necessary for you to know.

Let's use an industry-oriented example related to a **customer management system** for an e-commerce platform. This example will illustrate the best practices and pitfalls associated with getters and setters.

### **Industry-Oriented Example: Customer Management System**

**Scenario**:
In our e-commerce platform, we have a `Customer` class that manages customer details like name and email address. We'll demonstrate best practices and pitfalls related to getters and setters for this class.

#### **Code Example with Best Practices and Pitfalls**

```java
public class Customer {
    // Private fields to encapsulate data
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructor to initialize Customer
    public Customer(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        setEmail(email); // Using setter to validate email
    }

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        // Example of validation in setter
        if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be empty.");
        }
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for email
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    // Setter for email with validation
    public void setEmail(String email) {
        // Validate email format
        if (email == null || !email.contains("@")) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email address.");
        }
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Method to display customer details
    public void displayCustomerInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + getName());
        System.out.println("Email: " + getEmail());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Creating a Customer object with valid data
            Customer customer = new Customer("Alice Johnson", "alice.johnson@example.com");
            customer.displayCustomerInfo();

            // Updating customer details
            customer.setName("Bob Smith");
            customer.setEmail("bob.smith@example.com");
            customer.displayCustomerInfo();

            // Attempting to set invalid email
            customer.setEmail("invalid-email"); // This will throw an exception

        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Best Practices Illustrated**

1. **Validation in Setters**:
    - The `setEmail` method validates that the email contains an "@" symbol before updating it. This ensures that only valid email addresses are set, preventing invalid data from being stored.

2. **Encapsulation**:
    - The `name` and `email` fields are `private`, ensuring that they cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the `Customer` class. This protects the integrity of the data.

3. **Consistent Naming**:
    - The getter and setter methods follow the standard naming conventions (`getName`, `setName`, `getEmail`, `setEmail`), making the code easier to understand and maintain.

4. **Validation in Constructors**:
    - The constructor uses the `setEmail` method to validate the email address at the time of object creation. This ensures that an invalid email address cannot be set during initialization.

#### **Pitfalls Illustrated**

1. **Overexposure of Internal State**:
    - The example does not show overexposure, but if you were to add too many public getters and setters or expose internal fields directly, it could lead to breaking encapsulation.

2. **Complex Logic in Setters**:
    - While validation is necessary, placing too much logic in setters can be a pitfall. Here, validation is appropriate, but ensure that setters do not become too complex or perform unnecessary operations.

3. **Uncontrolled Changes**:
    - The example avoids this pitfall by validating inputs. However, if setters did not validate the data properly, it could lead to invalid states.

4. **Redundant Getters and Setters**:
    - In the example, getters and setters are used judiciously for fields that need controlled access. Avoid creating getters and setters for fields that do not require external access.

5. **Encapsulation Violation**:
    - The `Customer` class maintains encapsulation by keeping fields private and only allowing controlled access through public methods. Avoid exposing fields directly or allowing unrestricted modification.

### **Summary**

- **Best Practices**:
    - Use getters and setters to provide controlled access to private fields.
    - Validate data in setters to ensure the integrity of the object's state.
    - Follow standard naming conventions for readability and maintainability.

- **Pitfalls**:
    - Avoid overexposing internal state or placing complex logic in setters.
    - Ensure setters validate inputs to prevent invalid data from corrupting the object's state.

### **Encapsulating Behavior: Hiding Implementation Details**

**Encapsulation** is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit, called a class, and controlling access to that data. One key aspect of encapsulation is **hiding implementation details**.

#### **What Does Hiding Implementation Details Mean?**

**Hiding implementation details** means that a class hides the internal workings of its methods and data from the outside world. This concept helps to ensure that the internal state of an object can only be changed in controlled ways, which provides several benefits:

1. **Reduces Complexity**:
    - By hiding the internal details, you simplify the interaction with the object. Users of the class don’t need to understand or worry about how the class performs its tasks internally—they only need to know what the class does.

2. **Enhances Security**:
    - Encapsulation hides data and internal processes, which prevents unauthorized or unintended access. Only the class’s methods can modify its state, protecting the integrity of the object’s data.

3. **Improves Maintainability**:
    - Changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect other classes that use it, as long as the public interface remains the same. This makes it easier to update or refactor code without breaking other parts of the system.

4. **Promotes Flexibility**:
    - By encapsulating behavior, you can change the implementation details without affecting how other parts of the program interact with the class. This allows for more flexible and adaptable code.

#### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of a **car** as an analogy:

- **Car Interface**:
    - When you drive a car, you interact with it through the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift. You don’t need to understand how the engine, transmission, or braking system works internally to drive the car. You simply use the car’s controls to operate it.

- **Implementation Details**:
    - The car’s engine, fuel system, and braking mechanism are hidden from you. You don’t see the complex mechanisms or the specific internal components working together; you only use the car through its public interface (controls).

**Benefits of Hiding Implementation Details**:
- **Simplicity**: As a driver, you don’t need to understand the inner workings of the car to use it effectively.
- **Security**: You can drive the car safely without worrying about the risks of interacting with the internal mechanisms directly.
- **Maintainability**: Car manufacturers can update or improve the internal systems without changing how drivers operate the car.

#### **Encapsulation in Programming**

In programming, encapsulating behavior is achieved by:

1. **Private Fields**:
    - Keeping fields (variables) private so that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This ensures that external code cannot modify the internal state of the object directly.

2. **Public Methods**:
    - Providing public methods (getters and setters) to interact with the data. These methods control how data is accessed or modified, allowing you to enforce rules or validation.

3. **Internal Logic**:
    - Hiding complex internal logic or calculations within methods. External code interacts with the class through simple methods without needing to understand the underlying implementation.

4. **Interfaces**:
    - Defining clear interfaces or APIs that specify what the class does without exposing how it does it. This allows users to interact with the class using a consistent and predictable set of operations.

**Example**:
Imagine you have a `UserAccount` class that manages user credentials. The class might internally handle password hashing, validation, and storage. Users of the class only interact with it through methods like `login()` or `changePassword()`, without needing to know how these methods perform their tasks internally.

By hiding the details of how passwords are hashed and validated, you ensure that the implementation can be changed or improved without affecting how other parts of the application interact with the `UserAccount` class.

### **Summary**

- **Hiding Implementation Details** means concealing the internal workings of a class and exposing only a controlled interface.
- **Benefits**:
    - Reduces complexity
    - Enhances security
    - Improves maintainability
    - Promotes flexibility
- **Achieved by**:
    - Using private fields and public methods
    - Hiding complex logic within methods
    - Providing clear interfaces or APIs

Sure! Let's use a real-life industry-oriented example to illustrate encapsulating behavior and hiding implementation details: **a banking system**.

### **Industry-Oriented Example: Banking System**

In a banking system, we often have classes like `BankAccount` that manage financial transactions. We want to ensure that internal details about how transactions are processed or how account balances are calculated are hidden from the users of the class. This is crucial for maintaining security and data integrity.

### **Example: BankAccount Class**

**Scenario**:
We need to design a `BankAccount` class that allows customers to deposit and withdraw money, but we want to hide the internal details of how transactions are processed.

#### **Code Example**

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private field to store the account balance
    private double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the account with a balance
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance < 0) {

#### **Explanation**

1. **Private Field**:
    - The `balance` field is marked as `private`. This means that the balance can only be accessed or modified within the `BankAccount` class. Users of the class cannot directly alter the balance, which helps in protecting the data integrity.

2. **Public Methods**:
    - The `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance` methods are public. These methods provide controlled access to the `balance` field. They include validation to ensure that only valid operations are performed (e.g., no negative deposits or withdrawals).

3. **Internal Logic**:
    - The internal logic for updating the balance is hidden within the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods. Users interact with the account through these methods without needing to understand how the balance is adjusted internally.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - The class handles invalid operations (e.g., withdrawing more than the balance) and throws appropriate exceptions. This encapsulates the error-handling logic, making sure that invalid operations are caught and managed internally.

5. **Encapsulation Benefits**:
    - **Security**: The internal balance is protected from direct modification, reducing the risk of tampering or inconsistencies.
    - **Simplicity**: Users interact with the account through simple methods without needing to understand the internal details.
    - **Maintainability**: Changes to how the balance is managed or transactions are processed can be made within the class without affecting the code that uses the class.

### **Summary**

- **Encapsulating Behavior**: The `BankAccount` class hides the details of how balance updates are performed, exposing only a controlled interface for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.
- **Hiding Implementation Details**:
    - Fields (`balance`) are private.
    - Methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`) provide controlled access.
    - Internal logic and validation are managed within the class.
